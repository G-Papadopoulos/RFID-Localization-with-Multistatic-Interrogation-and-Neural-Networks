Each one of the three numbered .ipynb files contains the same code, with the only difference being the random seed, thus giving different splits of the dataset.

"Test Saved NN.ipynb" was used to conduct experiments on NNs that were already trained and saved.

All different setups were used to test the NNs, hence why the paths are so complicated. Also many different NN variables were tried.

Each NN was tested with random tag positions and two path scenarios.

Only the original setup can be tested on experimental data.
