Create datasets comprising of phase-based measurements and true 2D tag location, offered from a custom multistatic RFID interrogation setup. Multiple multistatic setups created.

Train Depp Feed-Forward Neural Networks that perform Regression to estimate the 2D location of an RFID tag, utilizing the phase-based measurements.

Experimental data from two real-world scenarios, that were used for evaluation, are also given.
